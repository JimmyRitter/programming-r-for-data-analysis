### 1. Which category of food has the highest average price?
```{r}
food_data <- read.csv("data/foodData.csv")

# group_by on "Category" and calculate average
group_categories <- food_data %>% 
                    group_by(Category) %>%
                    summarise(average = mean(Price))

# Sort by the highest mean price and get the first record
max_mean_price_category <- group_categories %>%
  arrange(desc(average)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 1)

max_mean_price_category
```

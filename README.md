- R Packages Add functionality to R

# Packages
- A package is a group of Functions, Data and Documentation
- To use a package, first you need to install it, and than load it

## install packages
- on console, type: `install.packages(<package-name>)`

## use a package
- import it in your script with `library(<package-name>)`

# Functions
- hover over a function, and press F1 to get the documentation

## Examples:
- `print()` -> prints the content in the console
- `print("Hello world")` -> 
- `print(x = "Hello word", quote = FALSE)` -> naming the parameters (useful when having multiple parameters, and to make it explicit)

- `c()` -> create a vector concatenating elements
- `myVector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)`

# Using RStudio
- Type the "object name" on the console to see it's value
- Click on the object on the "Environment section" to see it like a spreadsheet
